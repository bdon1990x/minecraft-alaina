## Proposal

### Summary of the Project

The idea we have chosen is an AI that is able to build different types of structures based on text-based commands. Commands may include details such as the size, shape, or color of a structure. Examples of such commands could be “build a red house” or “build a blue tower”. Given these commands the AI should be able to generate a structure according to the given specifications.

### AI/ML Algorithms

We plan on using supervised learning

### Evaluation Plan

#### Quantitative:

Completeness of the building. Is every block arranged correctly? Is any part of the structure missing?
Time the agent take to finish the task.
Mistakes the agent made through the process.

#### Qualitative:

- The project will start from a limited choices of parameters (one or two), to see whether the agent could build the house successfully. For example, the description could be “a house with a window and a door”. If the agent is able to make it, then we will enlarge the scale of our dataset, and be open for more parameters in descriptions, like the materials and texture of the structure.
- The moonshot case would be that we give it a ambiguous descriptions, like “a baroque-style house with a living room and two bedrooms” or “a shiny tower from which I can see the whole city”.

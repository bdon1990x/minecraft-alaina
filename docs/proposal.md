## Proposal

### Summary of the Project

Our project is to train a generative adversial network to build 3D object in Minecraft. We will start with generating chairs, and expand to other types of objects as time permits. Lastly we will implement text commands which will determine the type of object being generated.

### AI/ML Algorithms

We plan on using generative adversial networks. The dataset will be a set of 3D models, which will be voxelized so that it is more easily buildable in Minecraft. Text command could be implemented by simplying parsing the text for keywords.

### Evaluation Plan

#### Quantitative:

- Time the agent take to finish the task.
- Mistakes the agent made through the process.

#### Qualitative:

- Completeness of the building. Is every block arranged correctly? Is any part of the structure missing?

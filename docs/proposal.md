## Proposal

### Summary of the Project

The idea we have chosen is creating an AI that is able to build different types of structures based on text-based commands. Commands may include details such as the size, shape, or color of a structure. Examples of such commands could be “build a red house” or “build a blue tower”. Given these commands the AI should be able to generate a structure according to the given specifications.

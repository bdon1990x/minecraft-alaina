## Proposal

### Summary of the Project

Our project is to train a generative adversial network to build minecraft houses. We will start with building 2D houses. If results go well then we will move on to building 3D houses.

### AI/ML Algorithms

We plan on using generative adversial networks.

### Evaluation Plan

#### Quantitative:

- Time the agent take to finish the task.
- Mistakes the agent made through the process.

#### Qualitative:

- Completeness of the building. Is every block arranged correctly? Is any part of the structure missing?

### Appointment with the Instructor

Time: 09:30 am Oct 16, 2019
